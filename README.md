# Interactive-map-for-BRC-s-virtual-giftshop

The index.js uses data from IL_Simplified_WGS84.js, Ireland_WGS84.js and Region_Points.js to add the features and labels on the map. These are all geoJSON data saved in .js file format.

It also includes functions for the events and style of the features.

There are comments for all the functions. The colour of the features can change from the "color: " and "fillColor: " options in the index.js file, while the background colour is set in the style.css.
